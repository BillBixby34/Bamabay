# Bamazon Alpha
#### Soon-to-be competitor in the battle for online sales!

### What is Bamazon?

__Bamazon__ is an opportunity for the _truly_ adventurous among investors.  We are poised to become a multibillion dollar company in the land of online retail.  As we expand our marketplace to many different business both large and small, we project our profits will rise to accomodate __at least 3% growth__ per year over the next 5 years.


### How does Bamazon work?

As we are still in alpha, many changes have yet to occur.  For now, we will use node at the command line to interact with our __Bamazon__ marketplace!
