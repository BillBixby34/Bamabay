### What is Bamazon?

__Bamazon__ is an opportunity for the _truly_ adventurous among investors.  We are poised to become a multibillion dollar company in the land of online retail.

### How does Bamazon work?

As we are still in alpha, many changes have yet to occur.  For now, we will use node at the command line to interact with our __Bamazon__ marketplace!
